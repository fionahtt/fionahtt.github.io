	    <h1>Hey, I'm Fiona!</h1>
	    <p>I’m currently a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics and Machine Learning with minors in Computer Science and Music. Specifically, I’m interested in the growth of Artificial Intelligence and how it will integrate into our society in the future. </p>
		<p>Quick facts to get to know me better:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> As a music minor, my instruments of choice are piano and voice &#8212 though I’ve played piano for 15 years, I just recently joined Jazz Vocal Ensemble. You can often find me in the College of Fine Arts building at CMU, even when I’m coding, because the interior looks like <a href = "https://images.app.goo.gl/wzFXPUppgX4Rt2ex6" target="_blank">this</a>.</li>
			<li> One of my goals for 2020 (and forward) is to stay active and seek adventure. I love hiking and exploring new places both in the city and in the wilderness.</li>
			<li> In my free time, I enjoy fashion blogging. Right now, I’m learning more about ethical fashion and sustainable clothing brands. Check my blog out <a href="http://www.instagram.com/fionawearsthings" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I’m always excited for new opportunities &#8212 feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/fionathendean" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or contact me at fionahtt@gmail.com!</p>
